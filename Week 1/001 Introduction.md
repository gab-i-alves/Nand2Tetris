# Introduction

> Don't worry about the "how" only about the "what"

* how = implementation
* what = abstraction = waht our programming language promises to do
----
**One week at a time**

Every week:
* worry about a single level
* take the lower level as given
* implement the higher level
* test that it works
----
**By the end of the course**

You have built a complete functioning computer:
* that can run anything including games like tetris
* using only modest nand gates
----
**Two parts...**

Part I - this course - 7 weeks - hardware
* start with Nand
* create the HACK computer

Part II - forthcoming - 7 weeks - software
* start with the HACK computer
* create a full software hierarcy that runs applications like Tetris
----
**Weekly projects**

Week 1 - Elementary Logic Gates
Week 2 - Arithmetic - Logic Unit
Week 3 - Registers and Memory
Week 4 - Writing Low-Level Programs
